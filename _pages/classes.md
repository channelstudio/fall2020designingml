# Classes

## Class 1 - 10/30

Introductory class. We began by having everyone answer the following questions:

* Why are you taking this class?
* What is your background and experience? What are you interested in?
* What did you do this summer?

This class is about using machine learning to explore archives.

The data problem - we have more information now than ever before, and it is growing exponentially.

Cultural institutions are digitizing and open sourcing massive collections. Beyond this, what is a dataset? Perhaps shopping inventories are datasets? Movies are a dataset. Google photos is a dataset. 

There are growing datasets that we want to be able to search on a semantic basis.

At the same time, people expect better and better digital experiences. Companies like Google, Uber, etc are spending tons on design to create the best experiences they can. They are setting the bar for online experiences.

Design is about sorting/organizing/making information digestible. We are designing the experience of exploring a dataset using machine learning as a design tool.

A main concept for the class is using machine learning and AI to augment or facilitate, not to create.
