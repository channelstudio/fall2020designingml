# Classes

## Class 3 - 11/13

## Vectors and classification

### What is a vector?


* A vector has magnitude
* A vector has direction

A vector's magnitude is the length - the size. A vector is a set of instructions on how to get from the tail to the tip

### Why vectors?

  Vectors can be used for physics. Vectors can explain movement, static forces, and so many other things. Vectors can be used to describe position in a space. But when we talk about space we often think of 2d or 3d. Vectors can exist in many more dimenstions. And sometimes it makes sense to pair a bunch of numbers together! There are a bunch of operations we want to do on both numbers so we consider them together

Vector math we reviewed:

* Add/sub
* mult/div
* Magnitude
* Normalize

KNN

* "Tell me who your neighbor is, and I’ll tell you who you are"
* "K-Nearest Neighbor" is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. It is a "lazy learning" algorithm due to the fact that there is really is no learning at all. New data points are classified / valued according to a distance comparison with every data point in a training set. (source)[https://github.com/nature-of-code/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning/blob/master/week3-classification-regression/README.md]
* Nice interactive demo [here](https://observablehq.com/@nsthorat/how-to-build-a-teachable-machine-with-tensorflow-js) a bit further down the page

The notebook from the class should be listed on the "notebooks" page.

## Class 2 - 11/6

What is scripting?

* A scripting or script language is a programming language for a special run-time environment that automates the execution of tasks; the tasks could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted. - Wikipedia

Python is a scripting language that we will be using in this class. It is highly versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is quickly becoming one of the most popular languages.

Using the terminal, we installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

First, make sure you have Xcode command-line tools installed. Note - this is *not* the Xcode editor. These are separate tools that run from your command line. Run the commands below (without the `$` at the beginning of the line):

```console
$ xcode-select --install
```

Next, we install Homebrew by running the following command:

```console
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Run the following command once you’re done to ensure Homebrew is installed and working properly:

```console
$ brew doctor
```

Next, we install Python 

```console
$ brew install python
```

Check your install with the following command

```console
$ python --version
```

It should say report a version of python 3 or higher

Next we can use pip, pythons package manager, to install jupyter notebook and other dependencies:

```console
$ pip3 install jupyterlab
$ pip3 install matplotlib
```

We then run the command below to open a jupyter notebook. Make sure you are in the correct directory when you run this command.

```console
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Class 1 - 10/30

Introductory class. We began by having everyone answer the following questions:

* Why are you taking this class?
* What is your background and experience? What are you interested in?
* What did you do this summer?

This class is about using machine learning to explore archives.

The data problem - we have more information now than ever before, and it is growing exponentially.

Cultural institutions are digitizing and open sourcing massive collections. Beyond this, what is a dataset? Perhaps shopping inventories are datasets? Movies are a dataset. Google photos is a dataset. 

There are growing datasets that we want to be able to search on a semantic basis.

At the same time, people expect better and better digital experiences. Companies like Google, Uber, etc are spending tons on design to create the best experiences they can. They are setting the bar for online experiences.

Design is about sorting/organizing/making information digestible. We are designing the experience of exploring a dataset using machine learning as a design tool.

A main concept for the class is using machine learning and AI to augment or facilitate, not to create.

We also learned how to use the command line to do simple tasks

[Quick guide here](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line)

Import commands to be familiar with:
